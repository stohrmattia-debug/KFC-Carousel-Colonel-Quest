                        					Harland Sanders spent most of his life without wealth. Once he became successful late in life, he decided to share his fortune with those who needed it most. The trusts and charities that bear his name continue to donate millions to education and health care even today, and the March of Dimes / Colonel Harland Sanders Award is given annually to an individual whose lifetime body of research and education has made significant contributions to the genetic sciences.

                    					Harland Sanders spent most of his life without wealth. Once he became successful late in life, he decided to share his fortune with those who needed it most. The trusts and charities that bear his name continue to donate millions to education and health care even today, and the March of Dimes / Colonel Harland Sanders Award is given annually to an individual whose lifetime body of research and education has made significant contributions to the genetic sciences.

		<p>Learn how a sixth-grade dropout became a colonel.</p>

		<div>
			<p>At the age of 10 I became a farmhand, making $2 a month. That probably doesn’t seem like a lot to you, but in the 1800s that was nearly $4!</p>
			<p>I quit school in sixth grade because I didn’t care much for math.
Surprisingly, no one questioned this decision.</p>
			<p>At 16 I lied about my age and enlisted in the army. I was stationed in Cuba, where I took care of mules and learned not to lie.</p>
			<p>In the early 1920s I sold tires and became the top salesman in Kentucky and was fired. They said it was my temper. You can imagine my response.</p>
			<p>I operated a steamboat ferry between Indiana and Louisville. No one knows why it ended because someone didn’t do a great job of recordkeeping.</p>
